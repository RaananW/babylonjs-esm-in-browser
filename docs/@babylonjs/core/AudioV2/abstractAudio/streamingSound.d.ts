 * Abstract class representing a streaming sound.
 *
 * A streaming sound has a sound buffer that is loaded into memory in chunks as it is played. This allows it to be played
 * more quickly than a static sound, but it also means that it cannot have loop points or playback rate changes.
 *
 * Due to the way streaming sounds are typically implemented, there can be a significant delay when attempting to play
 * a streaming sound for the first time. To prevent this delay, it is recommended to preload instances of the sound
 * using the {@link IStreamingSoundStoredOptions.preloadCount} options, or the {@link preloadInstanceAsync} and
 * {@link preloadInstancesAsync} methods before calling the `play` method.
 *
 * Streaming sounds are created by the {@link CreateStreamingSoundAsync} function.
